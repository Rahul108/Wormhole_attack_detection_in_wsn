# Introduction

Wireless sensor networks(WSNs) consist of many interconnected self-controlled device(i.e sensor nodes) that are used in a collective manner to monitor and/or contorl environmental phenomena in local or remote environments[8]. Sensor nodes
which are spacially distributed communicate with their peers in order to send aggregated data to the base station efficiently. WSN is a spacial kind of Mobile Adhoc network that has gained popularity for its versatile application in military and civil domains such as battlefield monitoring, tracking objects, healthcare and home automation. Due to the broadcast nature of the transmission medium and fact that sensor nodes often operate in hostile environments. WSN are vulnerable to variety of security attacks[1]. This chapter contais some introductory information on wormhole attack in wireless sensor network, motivation of our work, challanges of implementing our work and our objectives.


# Wormhole Attack in Wireless Sensor Network
The wormhole attack is recognized as one of the most dangerous security threats for WSNs. This attack has one or more malicious node and a tunnel between them. The attacking nodes capture the packets from one location and transfers them to
other distant location node which distributes them locally[1]. The tunnel can be established in many ways e.g in-band and out-of-band channel.Routing mechanisms which rely on the knowledge about distance between nodes can get confuse because
because wormhole nodes fake a route that is shorter than the original one within the network[1].
