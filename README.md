# Introduction

Wireless sensor networks(WSNs) consist of many interconnected self-controlled
device(i.e sensor nodes) that are used in a collective manner to monitor and/or
contorl environmental phenomena in local or remote environments[8]. Sensor nodes
which are spacially distributed communicate with their peers in order to send
aggregated data to the base station efficiently. WSN is a spacial kind of Mobile Adhoc network that has gained popularity for its versatile application in military and
civil domains such as battlefield monitoring, tracking objects, healthcare and home
automation. Due to the broadcast nature of the transmission medium and fact
that sensor nodes often operate in hostile environments. WSN are vulnerable to
variety of security attacks[1]. This chapter contais some introductory information
on wormhole attack in wireless sensor network, motivation of our work, challanges
of implementing our work and our objectives.
